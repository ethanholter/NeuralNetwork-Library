## Overview

This is my first attempt at creating a supervised learning neural network library. It includes a 'NeuralNetwork' class and a minimal 'Matrix' class to more easily handle the math.

Overall this project is intended as learning experience and is in no way, shape, or form optimized for practical applications.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `bin`: the folder where compiled java files are generated


## Future Plans

- implement the ability to have a custom number of layers
- add more activation functions
- implement alternative learning algorithms (genetic/evolution)
- implement importing and exporting of network models
- add more examples to showcase the abilities of this library (currently just XOR problem)
